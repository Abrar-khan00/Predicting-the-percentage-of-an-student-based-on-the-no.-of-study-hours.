**Project Name: Student Performance Predictor**
This project aims to predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours. It uses a simple linear regression model to make the prediction.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is provided in this link "**http://bit.ly/w-data**". The dataset contains two columns: **Hours** and **Scores**.
The **Hours** column represents the number of study hours and the **Scores** column represents the percentage score obtained by the student.

**Dependencies**
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
To run the project, simply open the **Sol1. Linear Regression.ipynb** notebook in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.
The notebook contains detailed explanations of each step involved in the project.

**Results**
After training the model on the dataset, we were able to achieve an accuracy of **96.5%** on the test data.
The model was then used to predict the percentage of a student who studies for **9.25** hours a day. The predicted percentage was **93.69%**.
